This complex multiple system has had numerous identification errors due to various difficulties. The diagram of Lewis in his catalog of the Struve pairs (MemRAS, 56, 107; 1906) which seemed a good first step was hampered by the quadrant error of the pair he designated Ca. This quadrant error was repeated in the ADS, IDS, and in earlier editions of the WDS. In the ADS (where this pair is listed as # 2984, but note that # 2989 is part of this system, too) the errors multiplied. The pair Holmes AF (WDS designation HLM   3AF) is apparently the same as STF 485Ac. Inspection of scanned images of this region of the sky have allowed the Hertzsprung pairs (HZG   2) whose components are given within quotation marks in the ADS to be identified. Of the HZG pairs, the "CD" pairing is the same as STF 484AC and the "CE" pairing is the same as STF 484AB. The ADS note to the "AJ" pairing of HZG   2 is a typo.

This complex multiple system has had numerous identification errors due to various difficulties. The diagram of Lewis in his catalog of the Struve pairs (MemRAS, 56, 107; 1906) which seemed a good first step was hampered by the quadrant error of the pair he designated Ca. This quadrant error was repeated in the ADS, IDS, and in earlier editions of the WDS.
