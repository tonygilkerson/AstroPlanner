Main stellar data presented in    the ASCC-2.5 are the equatorial coordinates (J2000, epoch 1991.25),    proper motions in the Hipparcos system, B and/or V stellar magnitudes    in the Johnson system. Additionally for some stars are given    trigonometric parallaxes, spectral classes in the MK or HD system,    multiplicity and variability flags, Hipparcos, Tycho-2, HD, DM    designations.    Equatorial coordinates and their standard errors were taken from the    source catalogues in accordance with the priority: Hipparcos    (I/239/hip_main), Tycho-2 (I/259), Tycho-1 (I/239/tyc_main), CMC11    (I/256), PPM (I/146, I/193, I/208).    Proper motions from the source catalogues were compared with Hipparcos    data. The compiled proper motions in the Hipparcos system and their    standard errors were computed as the weighted means. The weights were    set in accordance with the proper motion errors listed for individual    stars in the source catalogues.    Trigonometric parallaxes are taken from Hipparcos and Tycho-1    catalogues.    Stellar B, V magnitudes were determined on the basis of the    ground-based photometric data taken from CMC11, Hipparcos, and space    B_T_, V_T_ from Tycho-1, Tycho-2. Magnitudes from PPM catalogue were    used if no other photometric data were available. Tycho data were    transformed to the Johnson system with:               V = V_T_ - 0.09 (B-V)_T_ + d_V_,           (B-V) = 0.850 (B-V)_T_ + d_(B-V)_,    i.e. using recommendations from the Introduction to the Tycho    catalogue and including additional corrections d_V_ and d_(B-V)_.    These additional corrections were determined by comparison with    ground-based data in the Johnson system. These corrections depend    non-lineary on colour and reach 0.02 and 0.04 mag, respectively.    Spectral classes in MK or HD systems were taken from Hipparcos, CMC11,    and PPM catalogues.    Multiplicity and variability flags were taken from Tycho-1, Tycho-2,    Hipparcos, CMC11, and PPM catalogues.    The 1st version of the ASCC-2.5 contained some errors in the zones    -1 to +1 degree which have been corrected (see details in the    "History" section below); 2 files (ccp00.dat and ccm00.dat) have    consequently been modified, and a new file (ccadd.dat) contains the    previously missing stars (including components of multiple systems).    Notice that the ASCC numbers did not change between the two versions,    but additional numbers (2600001 to 2603318) were assigned.[[ASCCLite.apcat]]Identical to the All-sky Compiled Catalog, except that only stars of magnitude 9.5 or brighter are included.[[Barnard.apcat]][[BD.apcat]]Bonner Durchmusterung (Argelander, F.W. 1859-62, Bonner Sternverzeichnis.

Dummlers Verlag, Bonn)The Bonner Durchmusterung (BD, Argelander 1859-62, Kuestner 1903, Becker 1951, Schmidt 1968) is a visual survey of stars in the declination zones +89 to -01 degrees. The survey, completed by Argelander and his assistants in the years 1852-1861, was performed and the stars cataloged by allowing the telescope to drift along the mean declination of each zone and recording the positions and magnitudes of stars crosssing the transit line of each field. The goal of the survey was to obtain a position and estimated visual magnitude for every star visible with the 78-mm Bonn telescope. Actual magnitude estimates were made and reported to 0.1 mag for all stars down to 9.5 mag, with fainter stars being assigned to 9.5. Thus, the BD actually contains a rather large number of stars fainter than 10.0 mag. Positions are given to the nearest 0.1 sec in right ascension and 0.1 arcmin in declination.[[Bedford.apcat]]Compiled by Michael PayneNOTES:There are 850 objects listed in the original Bedford Catalogue.  Because there are multiple objects listed in some entries in the Catalogue, I have listed those objects separately with an alphabetic suffix to distinguish them, e.g. 92A, 92B.   The catalogue numbers so affected are:92: The Double Cluster216: The Orion Nebula369: M-81 and M-82848: The Coma-Virgo Cluster of GalaxiesSince Smyth uses the Piazzi Palermo Catalogue of double stars, the identification of some of the double stars is uncertain, due to there being no accessible catalogue of double stars that cross-references that of Piazzi.  In many cases, though, Smyth lists the Piazzi entry along with references to Herschel, South, and Struve, which enables a clear identification.  Where no such cross-references were available, many times by comparing Smyth's description with the description of the object produced by entering Smyth's coordinates and precessing them to Epoch 2000 was sufficient to confirm identification.  In a few instances identification ought to be confirmed visually at the eyepiece.SourcesSmyth, William H., "The Bedford Catalogue" from A Cycle of Celestial Objects.

The  catalog  contains  the  identifications  of  included stars in several other widely-used catalogs, double- and  multiple-star  identifications,  indication  of  variability  and  variable-star identifiers, equatorial positions for  B1900.0  and  J2000.0,  galactic  coordinates,  UBVRI photoelectric photometric  data when they exist, spectral types on  the  Morgan-Keenan  (MK)  classification   system,   proper  motions  (J2000.0),  parallax,  radial-   and   rotational-velocity   data,   and   multiple-star  information  (number  of  components,  separation,  and magnitude  differences) for known nonsingle stars.  In addition to the  data  file, there is an extensive remarks file that gives more detailed  information  on  individual  entries.   This information includes  star  names,  colors,  spectra,   variability   details,   binary  characteristics,  radial  and rotational velocities for companion  stars,  duplicity  information,  dynamical  parallaxes,   stellar  dimensions (radii and diameters), polarization, and membership in  stellar groups and clusters.  The existence of remarks is flagged  in the main data file.  The  BSC  contains  9110  objects,  of  which  9096 are stars (14  objects cataloged in the original compilation of 1908  are  novae  or  extragalactic objects that have been retained to preserve the  numbering, but most of their data are omitted), while the remarks  section is slightly larger than the main catalog.    The  present  edition of the compilation includes many new data and the remarks  section has been enlarged considerably.[[Burnham.apcat]]Derived from WDS 2001 by extracting all of the S.W.Burnham objects (Name = BUxxxx)[[Caldwell.apcat]][[Carbon.apcat]]III/227    General Catalog of galactic Carbon stars, 3d Ed.

Nac. Argentino 16,17,18,21)The "Cordoba Durchmusterung" (CD, Thome 1892-1932) is a visual survey ofsouthern stars in the declination zones -22 to -89 deg, carried out as anextension to the "Bonner Durchmusterung" (BD) catalogs of Argelander (1859-1862)(see also Kuestner 1903) and Schoenfeld (1886).  The survey was performed usingtechniques similar to those used for the BD, i.e., the stars were cataloged byallowing the telescope to drift along the mean declination of each zone andrecording the positions and magnitudes of stars crossing the transit line ofthe field.  The goal of the survey was to obtain a position and estimated visual magnitude for every star down to 10.0 magnitude inclusive, but the faintlimit was confirmed from comparisons with other catalogs, to be somewhat below 10.  The positional uncertainties quoted in the original publications vary from+/- 0.42 sec and +/- 0.23 arcmin for zones -22 to -32 deg and  +/- 0.33 sec,+/- 0.10 arcmin for zones -42 to -51 deg (errors are not given in the published catalogs south of -51 deg, as these were published after Thome's death in 1908), no doubt due to improved observing techniques and equipment, such as the use of a faintly illuminated reticle, for the later work.[[Cederblad.apcat]][[CGPN.apcat]]   Catalogue of Galactic Planetary Nebulae     Kohoutek L.    <Astron.

The original goal of the work was to carry out a southern survey similar to those of the "Bonner Durchmusterung" (BD, Argelander 1859-1862, seealso Kuestner 1903) and Schoenfeld (1886) and the "Cordoba Durchmusterung" (CD,Thome 1892-1932) but using photographic plates which would provide a  permanentrecord of the sky at the epoch of observation.  The summary of the positionaluncertainties quoted in the third volume of the published catalog  gives   +/- 0.28 sec (R.A.), +/- 0.044 arcmin (Dec.) for zones -18 to -57 degrees,   +/- 0.157 sec + 0.0764/cos(delta) sec (R.A.), +/- 0.056 arcmin (Dec.) for zones -58 to -85 degrees, and +/- 0.157 sec + 0.0353/cos(delta) sec (R.A.), +/- 0.0127 arcmin (Dec.) for the polar plate where, as explained in the intro-duction to the third volume, many positions were derived from rectangular coordinates (these are positions reported to 0.1 sec (R.A.) and 0.001 arcmin (Dec.) in  the -86 to -89 degree zones in the catalog). The probable error of a photographic magnitude, as determined by combining results for different magnitudes and weighting proportionately according to the numbers of stars in each class of magnitude, is given as +/- 0.055 mag. From an analysis of the faint magnitude limits on the plates discussed in the third volume intro-duction, the catalog  as a whole can be considered complete to photographic magnitude 9.2, but it is stated that it will be found practically complete, in or near the Milky Way, to magnitude 9.5.  The total number of stars in the zones -19 to -89 degrees and the total sky area covered result in a mean density of 32.66 stars per square degree, as compared with 15.19 for Argelander's BD, 18.21 for  Schoenfeld's SD, and 56.00 for the CD zones -22 through -41 degrees.[[CPM.apcat]]I/121               Common proper motions stars in AGK3  (Halbwachs, 1986)================================================================================Common proper motion stars in the AGK3     Halbwachs J.L.    <Astron.

Although the faint limit varies from plate to plate and the southern      plates were superior to the northern ones (Hoffleit 1985, private               communication) a realistic value appears to be approximately m(pg) = 9. The     resulting spectral types were published in The Henry Draper Catalogue (HD,      Cannon and Pickering 1918-1924).  Later, she classified somewhat fainter stars  in a number of regions of the sky.  This work was completed by Mrs. Mayall and  published as "The Henry Draper Extension" (HDE, Cannon 1925-1936; Cannon and    Walton Mayall 1949).  A machine version of the HD and of the first volume of    HDE was originally prepared under the supervision of D. Hoffleit at the Yale    University Observatory some years ago (Hoffleit 1967; Gottlieb and Hoffleit     1969), and was subsequently updated with known errors (including some in the    printed catalog) at the Astronomical Data Center (ADC) in 1976.  The current    version of the HD contains the corrections for all errata known to us and/or    published up to the date of this version (February 1985), various errors        forwarded to us by colleagues, and errors discovered at the ADC during the      course of this work.  In addition, the regions of the HDE (1925-1936) for the   declination zones +50 to +59 degrees and for the Magellanic Clouds have been    changed to the same format as the basic catalog.  Right ascensions and          declinations have replaced the X,Y coordinates in the Magellanic-Cloud region.  This version of the machine-readable HD/HDE does not contain the last volume of the HDE (1949) because no positions are currently available in machine form for stars in the range HDE 272151-359083.                                           [[Herschel.apcat]][[Herschel400-I.apcat]][[Herschel400-II.apcat]][[HII_LMC.apcat]]VII/232             Nebulae in the Magellanic Clouds          (Davies+ 1976)================================================================================The nebular complexes of the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds.     Davies R.D., Elliot K.H., Meaburn J.    <Mem.

The satellite,    which operated for four years, returned high quality scientific data    from November 1989 to March 1993.    Each of the catalogues contains a large quantity of very high quality    astrometric and photometric data. In addition there are associated    annexes featuring variability and double/multiple star data, and solar    system astrometric and photometric measurements. In the case of the    Hipparcos Catalogue, the principal parts are provided in both printed    and machine-readable form (on CDROM). In the case of the Tycho    Catalogue, results are provided in machine-readable form only (on    CDROM). Although in general only the final reduced and calibrated    astrometric and photometric data are provided, some auxiliary files    containing results from intermediate stages of the data processing, of    relevance for the more-specialised user, have also been retained for    publication. (Some, but not all, data files are available from the    Centre de Donnees astronomiques de Strasbourg.)    The global data analysis tasks, proceeding from nearly 1000 Gbit of    raw satellite data to the final catalogues, was a lengthy and complex    process, and was undertaken by the NDAC and FAST Consortia, together    responsible for the production of the Hipparcos Catalogue, and the    Tycho Consortium, responsible for the production of the Tycho    Catalogue. A fourth scientific consortium, the INCA Consortium, was    responsible for the construction of the Hipparcos observing programme,    compiling the best-available data for the selected stars before launch    into the Hipparcos Input Catalogue.

When    Luyten had noticed that an entry was duplicated (ref. 8 and 9), only    the former LDS number was kept in the data file but with the data    given for the latter. The unique exception is LDS 6166, which is a    duplicate of LDS 5662, but with an additional component.    The systems classified as optical by Luyten were also rejected from    the main data files. All the rejected data were put together in a    separate file. All coordinates are for the equinox 1950; when the    original publication gave another equinox (this is the case for ref.    1), the 1950-coordinates were calculated.    The catalogue contains all the systems, sorted by increasing LDS    numbers. Duplicate entries and optical systems listed by Luyten were    rejected. The catalogue contains 6121 systems, including 87 triple and    1 quadruple systems.

The 2MASS J,H,K magnitudes of these objects    have been transformed to the same homogeneous photometric system of    existing near infrared photometry of M31 globulars, finally yielding    J,H,K integrated photometry for 279 confirmed M31 clusters, 406    unconfirmed candidates and 8 objects with controversial    classification. Of these objects 529 lacked any previous estimate of    their near infrared magnitudes. The newly assembled near infrared    dataset has been implemented into a revised version of the Bologna    Catalogue of M31 globulars, with updated optical (UBVRI) photometry    taken, when possible, from the most recent sources of CCD photometry    available in the literature and transformed to a common photometric    system.

We have found    67 new objects in M31 and 35 in M33 and confirmed 38 and 16 previously    discovered ones. A VI and BVI photometry has been obtained for all    clusters in M31 and M33, respectively. Luminosity functions have been    constructed for the clusters in each galaxy and compared with that of    the Milky Way.Note: Probability Classes for globular clusters:   A: very high probability globular cluster candidates, exhibiting      spherical structure and a substantially larger FWHM than for a      nearby star.    B: high probability globular cluster candidates. Objects in this       category usually exhibited small departures from spherical shape       not associated with the object itself, caused by nearby faint      stars, brightness fluctuations of the galaxy background, etc.   C: objects that might be globular clusters. Such objects were usually      faint and roughly spherical. Due to their faintness, their radial      profiles showed substantial background variations. Thus it was      hard to discern whether they were globular clusters or blended       stars.   D: Objects that are probably not globular clusters. Objects in this      category met the above criteria rather poorly, usually because of      low S/N ratio. Objects from other catalogs which were found       unlikely to be globular clusters were also put into this category.[[Markarian.apcat]][[MASH.apcat]]V/127               MASH Catalog of Planetary Nebulae        (Parker+ 2006)====================================================The Macquarie/AAO/Strasbourg Halpha  Planetary Nebula Catalogue (MASH)    Parker Q.A., Acker A., Frew D.J., Hartley M., Peyaud A.E.J., Phillipps S.,    Russeil D., Beaulieu S.F., Cohen M., Koppen J., Marcout J., Miszalski B.,    Morgan D.H., Morris R.A.H., Ochsenbein F., Pierce M.J.,   <Reference (2006)>   =2006MNRAS.in.press.====================================================Description:    The Macquarie/AAO/Strasbourg Halpha Planetary Nebula Catalogue (MASH)    contains 905 new true, likely and possible Galactic Planetary Nebulae    (PNe) discovered from the AAO/UKST Halpha survey of the southern    Galactic plane.

The catalog was based on    Palomar Sky Atlas prints and comprises areas from -30 to -45 degrees    in declination. In contrast to the earlier four volumes of the    catalog, the fifth was based on the red prints of the Sky Survey only.    Visual magnitude estimates are thus in the red. Note that in all cases    when in other sources the photoelectric B or photographic magnitude of    galaxies are encountered, preference to those values has been given    over those of Vorontsov-Velyaminov's estimates. All notes to galaxies    published in the earlier volume are included here as well (Kogoshvili    1983). In addition, the following data were used from the ESO/Uppsala    survey (Lauberts 1982): magnitudes, colors, radial velocities, Hubble    types, and galaxy diameters as measured on the ESO(B) atlas plates up    to the surface brightness slightly fainter than 25 magnitudes per    square arcsec. These maximum major and minor galaxy diameters are    provided in the fifth volume in place of the values taken from the UGC    catalog in the earlier four volumes. Various data from both the    reference Catalog of Bright Galaxies (de Vaucouleurs et al. 1964) and    B-V and U-B colors from the General Catalogue of Photoelectric    Magnitudes and Colours (Longo et al. 1983) were included.

It depends mainly on a preliminary version    (Spring 1989) of the new General Catalogue of Trigonometric    Parallaxes (YPC) prepared by Dr. William F. van Altena (Yale    University).    The catalogue contains every star with trigonometric parallax    greater than or equal to 0.0390 arcsec, even though it may be    evident from photometry or for other reasons that the star has a    larger distance. For red dwarf stars, new color-magnitude    calibrations for broad-band colors were carried out and applied.    For white dwarfs, the recipes of McCook and Sion were applied    (=1985ApJS...65..603M). Stroemgren photometry was used (not yet    systematically) for early-type stars and for late dwarfs, the    latter supplied by E. H. Olsen from Copenhagen Observatory    (private communication).    Contrary to the CNS2 (Gliese 1969) trigonometric parallaxes    and photometric or spectroscopic parallaxes were not combined.    The resulting parallax in the present version is always the    trigonometric parallax -- if the relative error of the    trigonometric parallax is smaller than 14 percent. The resulting    parallax is the photometric or spectroscopic parallax only if no    trigonometric parallax is available or if the standard error of    the trigonometric parallax is considerably larger.[[NexStar.apcat]][[NGC.apcat]]VII/239A   History and Accurate Positions for the NGC/IC Objects  (Corwin, 2004)================================================================================History and Accurate Positions for the NGC/IC Objects (Version July 2004)     Harold G.

New    objects and new data, in particular, data on kinematics (proper motions) that were not present    in the old catalogues, have been included. Virtually all the clusters (1629) presently known    were included, which represents an increment of about 476 objects relative to the Lynga (1987)    catalogue. The catalogue is presented in a single table containing all the important data,    which makes it easy to use.    In total, 99% of the objects have estimates of their apparent diameters, and 38% have distance,    E(B-V) and age determinations.

But, with a wide field instrument or some binoculars, there is a lot to see.  The Asterisms data that accompanies this document contains information on a wide variety of star grouping of a variety of sizes and shapes.  Some are ancient and easy to spot, some are more modern and demand a pair of binoculars or a small telescope.  Look carefully at the sizes given, that will give you an idea what instrument to use as you search for these "star pictures".A big thank you to Phil Harrington.  We interchanged emails about star groupings and that electronic conversation is the basis for almost half of the objects in the list.  The Deep Sky Group from Cloudy Nights dot com also provided lots of good information.  Gene Lucas provided data on several of the asterisms when I had trouble finding their position.  SAC members provided information on a couple of asterisms that are used in my local observing group:  Skip Loader, Swoosh, Saxophone and Tuft in the Tail.  Do not count on the data here being precise.  I measured the size and magnitude of many of these asterisms using my planetarium program, Sky Map Pro.  I do believe that most of the positions are good enough to get the asterism into a wide field eyepiece in many cases.  Of course, for the huge asterisms no instrument will show you the complete star picture.  The Big Dipper or The Teapot are not telescopic objects.As always, a big thank you to Bill Anderson for helping me manipulate the data into the final format.There are enough asterisms here to keep an observer busy for a while, but if you know of more, please email me and I can add them to the list.Clear Skies;Steve Coe email: stevecoe@ngcic.org[[SACDBL.apcat]][[SACDBL31.apcat]]SAGUARO ASTRONOMY CLUB DOUBLE STAR DATABASE VERSION 3.1                                                    dated 22 July 2006     Steve Coe     stevecoe@ngcic.orgMany members of our astronomy club have always enjoyed the beauty of multiple stars and in an effort to provide a list of these objects, this project was begun.

Thinking it would be an easy task, here we are nearly 25 years later, still  maintaining and updating a much larger listing of information about what to observe at the telescope.  How far we have come from the list of objects from Burnham's Celestial Handbook, all typed in on my Apple II+.  Time flies.  As always, if you find an error, please let us know.Much time and effort was spent to update the data with information available on the WWW.NGCIC.ORG Web site.  Thanks to Bob Erdmann for managing the site and providing this valuable resource.  Both Wolfgang Steineke and Dr. Harold Corwin have many hours of searching for, and correcting, errors in the NGC.  Their work is reflected in this release of the SAC database.  A small fraction of the number of objects still persist as NONEXISTENT, compared  to the beginnings of this database.  Brian Skiff of Lowell Obs. has  also been a constant help with a variety of information about  these deep sky objects.  Stephen Michael Schimpf spent much time with the NOTES field, finding errors and trying to make the  data more consistent.Besides myself, I am going to list the dedicated group of people who have helped keep this an up to date and useful database:  Bill Anderson, A.J. Crayon, David Fredericksen, Jack Jones, Jay LeBlanc and Paul Lind.    Thank you to the skill, knowledge and expertise of all who helped the Saguaro Astronomy Club create an excellent listing of what to observe in the deep sky.Versions 7.3 and 7.4 are internal to the SAC group working on the database.  They include changes in the data and additions to the brightnesses of central stars of planetary nebulae and open cluster data.  A few objects were both added and deleted.Version 7.5 is the latest release.[[SACRED20.apcat]]Documentation for SAC Red Stars Database Version 2.0by Steve Coe                      stevecoe@ngcic.orgFor as many years as we have been observing the sky, SAC members have enjoyed viewing stars with color.  These tints are subtle and demand training your eye to see them, but we consider it worthwhile so that you can start to see stars as something other than white.  Even with the naked eye some bright stars are ruddy in color; Antares and Betelgeuse are the most obvious examples.  Adding a telescope to the pursuit of color in stars means that many more stars can be seen in color.  Most often the colors viewed are mixtures of yellow, orange and red.Several avid observers from years past have created a numeric scale for judging color in stars.  I will provide you with just one of these, from J.F.J. Schmidt, who was the head of the observatory in Athens, Greece for many years.  Using a 6 inch refractor he discussed the colors he saw as "0 is pure white, 4 is pure yellow, 6 is deep golden yellow, 8 is orange and 10 is pure red".  He said that he never gave any star a rating of 10.The spectra of a star tells much about the chemistry, temperature and other physical conditions of the star.  The coolest "normal" stars are in spectral types K and M.  These stars often appear medium yellow to light orange to many observers.  The carbon stars are stars that are surrounded by a cloud of carbon soot.  This cloud filters out most of the blue light from the surface of the star and makes them much redder to an observer.  These stars are given the obvious designation "C" and the less obvious "N".  Bill Anderson helped with the creation of the database format and checked for accuracy.Steve Coe wrote the file you are reading and searched a variety of sources for the information that was added to this database.Alister Ling helped with checking for accuracy and helped with this read me file.Brian Skiff provided several excellent sources of tinted stars.[[SAO.apcat]]I/131A      SAO Star Catalog J2000     (SAO Staff 1966; USNO, ADC 1990)================================================================================Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory Star Catalog    SAO Staff   <Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory (1966)>================================================================================ADC_Keywords: Positional data ; Proper motionsDescription:    This machine-readable SAO catalog from the Astronomical Data Center is    based on an original binary version of the Smithsonian Astrophysical    Observatory Star Catalog (SAO, SAO Staff 1966). Subsequent    improvements by T. A. Nagy (1979) included the addition of equatorial    coordinates in radians and cross-identifications from the Table of    Correspondences SAO/HD/DM/GC (Morin 1973). As a prelude to creation of    the 1984 version of the SAO, a new version of the SAO-HD-GC-DM Cross    Index was prepared (Roman, Warren, and Schofield 1983). The 1984    version of the SAO contained the corrected and extended cross    identifications, all errata published up to January 1984 and known to    the ADC, numerous errors forwarded to the ADC by colleagues, and    errors discovered at the ADC during the course of this work. Clayton    A. Smith of the U. S. Naval Observatory provided J2000.0 positions and    proper motions for the SAO stars. Published and unpublished errors    discovered in the previous version (1984) have been corrected (up to    May 1991). The catalog contains SAO number; the right ascension and    declination with a B1950.0 equinox and epoch; annual proper motion and    its standard deviation, photographic and visual magnitudes; spectral    type; references to sources; the Durchmusterung (DM) identifier if the    star is listed in the Bonner DM (BD), Cordoba DM (CD), or Cape    Photographic DM (CP); component identification; The Henry Draper    (Extension) (HD or HDE) number; and J2000 positions and proper    motions. Multiple-star component identifications have been added to    stars where more than one SAO entry has the same DM number. The Henry    Draper Extension (HDE) numbers have been added for stars found in both    volumes of the extension. Data for duplicate SAO entries (those    referring to the same star) have been flagged. J2000 positions in    usual units and in radians have been added.[[SD.apcat]][[Shakhbazian.apcat]]VII/89B             Compact groups of compact galaxies  (Shakhbazian+ 1973-1979)================================================================================Compact groups of compact galaxies     Shakhbazian R.K.     <Astrophysics 9, 296-304 (1973)>Compact groups of compact galaxies.

The Tycho-2 positions    and magnitudes are  based on  precisely the  same observations  as the    original  Tycho  Catalogue  (hereafter  Tycho-1;  see  Cat.  <I/239>))    collected  by the  star mapper  of the  ESA Hipparcos  satellite,  but    Tycho-2 is much bigger  and slightly  more precise,   owing to  a more    advanced   reduction  technique.   Components  of  double  stars  with    separations down to 0.8 arcsec are included. Proper motions precise to    about 2.5 mas/yr are given as  derived  from  a  comparison  with  the    Astrographic   Catalogue  and   143  other   ground-based  astrometric    catalogues,  all reduced to the Hipparcos celestial coordinate system.    Tycho-2  supersedes in most applications Tycho-1,   as well as the ACT    (Cat.  <I/246>)  and TRC  (Cat. <I/250>)  catalogues based on Tycho-1.    Supplement-1  lists stars  from the  Hipparcos and  Tycho-1 Catalogues    which are not in Tycho-2.  Supplement-2 lists 1146 Tycho-1 stars which    are probably either false or heavily disturbed.    For more information, please consult the Tycho-2 home page:    http://www.astro.ku.dk/~erik/Tycho-2Catalogue Characteristics:    The principal characteristics of the Tycho-2 Catalogue are    summarized below.

The observed positional errors are about 20 mas for the stars in the 10 to 14 magnitude range, and about 70 mas at the limiting magnitude of R ~16.  For up-to-date information on the project, see our web pageat http://ad.usno.navy.mil/ucac/ .  This web page will also serve asthe location that the UCAC team will post addenda to the UCAC2 catalog.The UCAC2 is a high density, highly accurate, astrometric catalog of 48,330,571 stars covering the sky from -90 to +40 degrees in declinationand going up to +52 degrees in some areas.  The northern limit is afunction of right ascension.  Proper motions and photometry areprovided for all stars.  Positions and proper motions are on theICRS (International Celestial Reference System) and given at the epochJ2000.0.UCAC2 is the last intermediate data release before the final, all sky catalog will be constructed.  Observations will end around mid 2004; the final catalog is expected out in 2005.The UCAC project, observations, and first data release are described indetail in the paper Zacharias et al. AJ 120, 2131 (2000).  Versions of that and other related papers are placed on our Web page(http://ad.usno.navy.mil/ucac/).

Coverage is limited to the sky    north of declination -02.5degrees. Galaxies smaller than 1.0' in    diameter but brighter than 14.5 mag may be included from the Catalogue    of Galaxies and of Clusters of Galaxies (CGCG, Zwicky et al.    1961-1968); all such galaxies in the CGCG are included in the UGC. The    galaxies are ordered by 1950 right ascension.    The catalogue contains descriptions of the galaxies and their    surrounding areas, plus conventional system classifications and    position angles for flattened galaxies. Galaxy diameters on both the    blue and red POSS prints are included and the classifications and    descriptions are given in such a way as to provide as accurate an    account as possible of the appearance of the galaxies on the prints.    Only the data portion of the published UGC is included in the    machine-readable version.[[USNOA2.apcat]]                    USNO-A V2.0              A Catalog of Astrometric Standards                   David Monet a)	Alan Bird a), Blaise Canzian a), Conard Dahn a), Harry Guetter a),	Hugh Harris a), Arne Henden b), Stephen Levine a),	Chris Luginbuhl a), Alice K.

The major difference   between A2.0 and A1.0 is that A1.0 used the Guide Star Catalog   (Lasker et al. 1986) as its reference frame whereas A2.0 uses the   ICRF as realized by the USNO ACT catalog (Urban et al. 1997).   A2.0 presents right ascension and declination (J2000, epoch of the   mean of the blue and red plate) and the blue and red magnitude   for each star.  Usage of the ACT catalog as well as usage of new   astrometric and photometric reduction algorithms should provide   improved astrometry (mostly in the reduction of systematic errors)   and improved photometry (because the brightest stars on each plate   had B and V magnitudes measured by the Tycho experiment on the Hipparcos   satellite).  The basic format of the catalog and its compilation is the   same as for A1.0, and most users should be able to migrate to this   newer version with minimal effort.[[USNONegDblA.apcat]]A large number of systems in the WDS may be characterized as neglected.

This    census  of galactic  WR stars  reaches 227  stars,  comprising  127 WN    stars,  87 WC stars,  10 WN/WC stars and 3 WO stars.  This includes 15    WNL  and 11 WCL stars within 30 pc of the Galactic Center.  We compile    and  discuss WR  spectral classification,   variability,  periodicity,    binarity, terminal wind velocities, correlation with open clusters and    OB  associations,  and correlation with H I bubbles,  H II regions and    ring nebulae.  Intrinsic  colours and  absolute visual  magnitudes per    subtype  are re-assessed for a re-determination of optical photometric    distances  and  galactic  distribution  of  WR  stars.  In  the  solar    neighbourhood we find  projected  on  the  galactic  plane  a  surface    density of 3.3 WR stars per kpc^2^,  with a WC/WN number ratio of 1.5,    and  a WR binary frequency (including probable binaries)  of 39%.  The    galactocentric  distance (R_WR_)  distribution per subtype shows R_WR_    increasing with decreasing  WR  subtype,   both  for  the  WN  and  WC    subtypes.  This R_WR_  distribution  allows  for  the  possibility  of    WNE->WCE and WNL->WCL subtype evolution.[[XZ.apcat]][[ZC.apcat]][[Zwicky.apcat]]
