      <title>Tried V2.3a12 but when exiting the app it crashes and Microsoft error window appears</title>
      <description>I have tried installing V2.3a12 which launches correctly but announces that the plan I am using is incompatible with this version. The plans were created using version V2.2.anyway I have continue and the program functions correctly. It has corrected the bug where the stars near the pole didnt appear in the FOV. Anyway when I close the application it crashes to the desktop and I get the Microsoft error message which tries to find a solution on line. The application is loaded on to windows 7 SP1 Home premium laptops which are synchronised using a usb stick. When it crashes there is no synchronising or the challenge to save my work. All seems to work when I revert to V2.2 except the FOV does not display the stars near polaris.</description>

As Beta2.3a8 gives me errors I will do as before continue using Beta2.3a7 as that runs well with no problems. I would be happy if there was a activation app to remove the date expiry date nag screen. I have no complants about the software but I think you are tring to hard please everone what ever Computer they have. not sure what my error problem is it just states (Exception Type: Out Of Bounds Exception) Beta2.3a7 is the best version I have used for a lon time, it loads data faster than others ? My PC is an old Gigabyte P35 MB running Windows 10 home but most other things run with little problems. Thanks. </description>

      <title>Saving a protected (plan)file</title>
      <description>Some of my planfiles are protected files that I like to save under different names and as unprotected files. Currently, when hitting Cmd-S nothing happens; the planfile is not overwritten as it is protected. However, it would be useful if a "Save as..." dialogue would pop up in this instance, as it would allow a protected file to be saved under a different name. Currently File - Save As... is required.</description>

      <title>ERROR BOX ..........  Finding ID Synonyms for SUN</title>
      <description>I have had problem with AP Beta2.3a8 earlier today after logging observation of the Sun live at about 13:40 GMT. I got error after finished setting time, Scope, etc a box popped up with statement? (Finding ID Synonyms for SUN) it would not clear so I closed it with window button top Left. Then program locked up, so had to close AP and restart. After that I opened Observation database to complete info on the session but when clicked on save AP went into report bug mode.</description>

      <title>Sorting the custom highlighting scenario list</title>
      <description>Maybe I'm just not seeing it, but is there a way to sort the highlight scenario list? As I add more and more custom highlighting rules and rename existing ones, it's getting more difficult to manage. I need a button to alphabetically re-sort the custom rules I've created.</description>
      <analysis>In theory, clicking the title bar of that list should sort it. However, that does not appear to be the case, even though the title bar itself would indicate otherwise (which is a minor bug in itself).

Note that the list is always sorted in ascending order when you open the dialog. i.e. workaround for V2.2 is to click OK and re-open the dialog to get the list sorted.</analysis>

      <title>Adding a non-square user image results in a squashed image with black borders in FoV</title>
      <description>When I add a FITS image that I have capture with my ST-8E, I enter correct values for pixel scale, RA/Dec, Position Angle, etc.In the image manager, all seems well.However, when the image is viewed in the FoV pane, it has been forced square by adding black borders top and bottom, which means that the entered pixel scale is no longer correct and the image appears squashed. The black borders obscure items in the background.Additional info:Basically, if I add a user image that Ive taken with my ST-8E CCD, (1500-ish by 1024-ish, or roughly 3:2 aspect) the image gets forced into a square aspect ratio. The way it happens seems to vary depending on where it is viewed. On the object list it seems to be just squished into a square shape, which distorts the image. In the FoV screen, it gains solid black bars top and bottom to pad it to a square and because they are solid, they block out the background. Its probably right that different approaches are needed in the object list and FoV, but currently neither is really the right outcome. </description>

      <title>Short-term visibility indicator issue</title>
      <description>Right-clicking the visibility indicators and turning them on and off produces very strange results, in particular if the Short Range Visibility Indicator is turned off, it is tricky to get it to come back on again. Turning off both short-term and long-term indicators results in ALL of the indicators disappearing, even though when looking in the View Options, the Alt/Az indicator and the Constellation indicator remain enabled. I cant exactly pin down the problem but it all seems to point to a redraw problem when the short-term indicator is off.</description>

      <title>Add the current plan objects to the 'Find Objects Within Radius' query</title>
      <description>Basically the summary says it all. Is it possible to add the current working plan objects to what's being queried in the Find Objects Within Radius search?I'm an imager, and one of the things I check is what other objects are close by so I know how to frame my images. But, I've got many targets in my database that are not in any of the standard catalogs. So, being able to search my database too is really helpful.Whether it's a separate search, or included in the current choice, that doesn't matter. Just being able to include my database is really helpful.</description>

      <title>Beep sound when nested modal dialogs used</title>
      <description>When a modal dialog is used within another modal dialog, a beep (error?) sound is emitted (even though the nested dialogs work fine).</description>
      <analysis>Well, um, this shouldnt be allowed in the first place, by definition of modal dialog, but works OK on Windows and used to work on the Carbon version of the Mac app. Difficult to resolve in a cross-platform way without serious redesign.</analysis>

      <title>Choosing Make Observation Doesn't Switch to Observation Tab</title>
      <description>I think the application used to do this. Whenever I right click on an object in the Objects Tab and chose "Make Observation" the app does not switch over to the Observations Tab. Didn't the application do this in the past or was I imagining this behavior?</description>
      <analysis>Actually the Make Observation BUTTON does that, but the right-click does not. It probably should switch tabs too.</analysis>

      <title>Allow date/time qualifiers as values in the highlight rules</title>
      <description>Allow values from the Date/Time setting panel to be used in highlight rules.  For example, I have a highlight rule, which I have to manually adjust for the time of the year, to only show objects that are visible from sunset / civil twilight etc to around 1:30am when I am going to stop star gazing.Instead of me having to look up what time sunset will be on my planned date and then manually update my rule with that time, it would be nice to be able to specify that I want to see all objects visible from Sunset / nautical twilight etc to 1:30am.  That way I would never have to manually adjust the rule again.  Even having an offset like 15 minutes after the event would be nice.</description>

      <title>Export lists to APT not working.</title>
      <description>I recently started using APT to control my imaging sessions and have run into a problem with importing lists from AstroPlanner to it. When I export an object to an APT object list if the object has a positive ot north declination it is exported as 00 instead of whatever it should be. Here is an example. This is a cut and paste of an APT exported list of LBN 589. It's location in dec. should be +68.36.6 but is doesn't come out that way.&amp;lt;?xml version="1.0"?&amp;gt;-&amp;lt;Objects&amp;gt;-&amp;lt;Obj&amp;gt;&amp;lt;Object&amp;gt;LBN589&amp;lt;/Object&amp;gt;&amp;lt;NameNotes&amp;gt;Cederblad 214&amp;lt;/NameNotes&amp;gt;&amp;lt;Type&amp;gt;BN&amp;lt;/Type&amp;gt;&amp;lt;Const&amp;gt;Cep&amp;lt;/Const&amp;gt;&amp;lt;Mag&amp;gt;999.00&amp;lt;/Mag&amp;gt;&amp;lt;Size&amp;gt;65x20&amp;lt;/Size&amp;gt;&amp;lt;RA&amp;gt;00:03:36.0&amp;lt;/RA&amp;gt;&amp;lt;DEC&amp;gt;00:36:36.0&amp;lt;/DEC&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/Obj&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/Objects&amp;gt;As you can see, it skips the +68 portion of the declination. This occurs on all objects with a + dec that I have tried so far. Is there a fix for this other than manually editing each object?Thanks,RichardPS I'm using version 2.2 of AstroPlanner</description>

      <title>Computing FoV using field stop diameter</title>
      <description>I would like to see provision for entering the field stop diameter of an eyepiece in order to improve the accuracy of true field of view calculations.Yes, it is true that users do not always know that information, so the input of such data should be optional. Where the data is indeed entered by the user, the software could use the field stop diameter to calculate true field of view accurately, reverting to the potentially inaccurate use of apparent field of view for that calculation only in cases where the field stop diameter has not been specified.</description>
      <analysis>True FoV  = (field stop diameter)/(telescope focal length) * 180/pi  (degrees)http://www.televue.com/engine/TV3b_page.asp?id=79#.VJyk7AAA</analysis>
      <resolution>Implemented. In Resources &amp;gt; Eyepieces you can now choose to enter either Apparent FoV or Field Stop Diameter. In either case, the other value will be computed from the first.</resolution>

      <title>Field of View not showing stars near NCP</title>
      <description>I found a regression in Astroplaner 2.2. When the Field of View points near the NCP (north pole), no stars are shown. The screen shows  constellation figures and images but no stars.  I tested with the 'all-sky compiled' catalogue and others.Moving the Field of View away from the NCP makes the stars suddenly appear when the distance to NCP is about 1.5 times the current field of fiew diameter. This worked with previous versions, so apparently it was introduced by one of the more recent beta versions.</description>
